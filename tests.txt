#######################
Your totals should be thirty-two constants. Half of them are integers,
the other half are reals (float, double, long double). Have fun :)

Note: this assumes '+' signs in front of positive constants is valid

### VALID INTS:
//eight decimals
123
-123	//negative
123u	//unsigned
19842U	//unsigned
+123ul	//unsigned long
789Lu	//unsigned long
-542ll	//negative, long long
1uLL	//unsigned long long

//four octals
0123
0177u	//unsigned
+010000Ul	//unsigned long
030010llU	//unsigned long long

//four hexadecimal
0x1fA1
0X0u	//unsigned
+0XFb03cll	//long long
0x12eLLu	//unsigned long long


### INVALID INTS:
09	//can't have eights or nines with octal prefix
0x	//must have digits after hex prefix
-01	//octals can't be negative
-0xF	//hex can't be negative
-1U	//can't be negative with unsigned suffix
123Ll	//long long suffix must be either ll or LL
123lul	//can't insert unsigned suffix in long long suffix
1-1	//expression, not a constant, nor two constants
12j	//must end with a separator
j12	//must start with a separator
++12	//can't have two signs




### VALID REALS:
//eight without exponent
12.34	//double
-12.340000	//negative double
.12	//double without leading numbers
012.	//double without tailing numbers. may start with zero so long as it has a dot, making it real instead of octal
444.0f	//float suffix
-.02F	//negative, without leading numbers, float suffix
+3.L	//without tailing numbers, long double suffix
-0.l	//negative, long double suffix

//eight with exponent
1.2e3	//double with exponent
2.E-1	//double with negative exponent
+.000005e15	//long double with exponent
21.99E+0f	//float with exponent. zero is also a valid exponent
000000000099.3e6L	//long double. may start with zero so long as it has an exponent, making it real instead of octal/junk
-15e02	//double with exponent. no need to add dot if we have exponent. can have leading zeroes in exponent
006E-2F	//float with exponent. may start with zero so long as it has an exponent, making it real instead of octal/junk
